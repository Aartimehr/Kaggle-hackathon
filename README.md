 ** Project Title
Meta Kaggle EDA: Exploring Competition Trends Over Time

--> About the Project
This project analyzes Kaggleâ€™s competition data using the Meta Kaggle dataset. The aim is to discover trends in competition growth, participation, rewards, and structure. The analysis provides insights for both data enthusiasts and Kaggle participants on how the platform has evolved.

--> Key Objectives
1) Analyze how the number of competitions has changed over the years

2) Identify top competitions based on number of teams

3) Explore trends in rewards and their effect on participation

4) Clean and preprocess the Meta Kaggle dataset for effective analysis

 ** Dataset Used
--> File: Competitions.csv

--> Source: Meta Kaggle Dataset

** Steps Performed
--> Loaded and inspected the raw dataset

--> Cleaned column names and handled missing values

--> Parsed date columns and extracted year

--> Created visualizations for trends over time

--> Identified competitions with the highest team participation
--> Exported the cleaned dataset for further use or submission

** Summary of Insights
** The number of Kaggle competitions has increased significantly since its early years

--> A few major competitions have attracted very high team participation (e.g., Titanic, House Prices, etc.)

--> Most competitions do not offer cash rewards, but reward-based competitions tend to attract more attention

--> Team sizes are often capped but do not strictly correlate with the number of participants
